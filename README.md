This repository includes a screen record video of the click-through prototype of my design.

This is a Figma design of the Snapchat interface, showcasing the updated 3D bitmojis with an additional customisation option,- 'Pets'. This feature enables us to keep a 3D fur-buddy with our bitmoji. For all the dog-devouts and the feline-friendlies, I have kept separate sections with a variety of species to choose from and other than that, you can find a plethora of cute animals as well. My aim for designing this update is to appeal to the aesthetics and provide an adorable company to our bitmojis. 

The addition of animals is not only limited to our bitmoji previews. The filters which show little animations with our bitmojis will now include their tiny buddies as well. 

This feature is designed by an animal lover with the belief that everything gets a little brighter when a bark, a grunt, a purr or a neigh is added to it. ‚ù§
